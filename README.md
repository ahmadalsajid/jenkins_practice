Codes and documents for learning Jenkins


## Setup

Spin up the containers using the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)
file. Jenkins will be locally available at [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080).

Follow the initial setup and you are good to go. 

At the very beginning, you can follow the [Guided Tour to Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started/)
from the official documentation. After that, deep dive into Jenkins with the [official doc](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/).
